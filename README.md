### About Vespucci

Redefine data analysis with us.
There are currently two main ways to do analytics: either unsupervised or supervised. Unsupervised approaches are very powerful. Tools such as Mixpanel or Amplitude are very flexible through their funnels or persona tools, but they imply two things: on the one hand all the value that’s embedded in what you are not looking for is lost and on the other hand the quality of what you find depends on the quality of the people looking for it. The use of supervised solutions such as Hotjar, UXCam or FullStory avoid these drawbacks, but they have the important flaw of not being easily scalable. 

With Vespucci we are relaying on maths and stats to build an analytics solution that’s both unsupervised and scalable. By doing so, we want to industrialize data analysis and help more people make decisions based on facts and not on gut feeling. It's a demanding journey. We need to build a robust infrastructure that can handle a large volume of data. We also need to build and evolve a product that is familiar to a broad user base. The quality of our user experience is crucial in our approach, we need to demystify data for our users. It's about making the boring engaging.
